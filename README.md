# Ocean Cleanup Game Prototypes

Game prototypes to promote ocean conservation which are currently hosted on [itch.io](https://foligno.itch.io/ocean-cleanup).

Created in Unity version 2022.3.57f1.

I thought I'd upload the code in case it can be used to help anyone else create a simple project in Unity.

### Layout

The `Assets/Shared` folder contains the bulk of the content for the game. Different game mode specific content is split into
`Assets/SuckerCat`, `Assets/WaterGun` and `Assets/Smasher`.

### Notes

Some things to take note of if you're going to use this code to learn:

- This was mostly put together in a day, the code is not perfect.
- There are inconsistent variable naming conventions throughout the code.

If you have any questions about the code, feel free to create an issue.
